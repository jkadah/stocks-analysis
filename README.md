# Challenge 2: Stocks Analysis 
This is an analysis of a large collection of stock data to find the Total Daily Volume and return. This will allow Steve and his parents to deternine stock trends and which is a better option to invest in. 
There is a button that allows Steve to dtermine which year he would like to run the analysis on. He can also clear the worksheet to run analysis on another year. This code will also work if Steve adds more data/stocks to the worksheets because it has been refactored to work for most data sets.
